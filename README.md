The increasing globalization of the world has made supply chains extremely complex and critical. Due to this, researchers have been constantly looking to apply cutting-edge computing techniques to the complex supply chain domain to understand relations. Recently, there have been investigations into applying both NLP sentiment analysis and quantum machine learning techniques to supply chain management. Research has revolved primarily around issues such as logistics, development, risk analysis, demand forecasting, and cybersecurity. However, innovative analysis on the influence of supply chain interconnectedness on the stock market has been neglected. 

Stock price prediction is a notoriously difficult and complex problem$^3$. The nature of supply chains means that an impact on one company's operations may cascade into influencing the operations of other companies as well. Analysis of these supply chain cascading processes made provide a novel method of predicting stock price movement. Another problem in stock market forecasting is the human aspect of the market; human emotions play a large role in driving stock image, supply, and demand. 

This study proposes using NLP sentiment analysis and quantum machine learning methods to attempt to resolve these issues. Sentiment analysis may allow algorithms to understand the human perception aspect of the market, and quantum computing may solve the highly stochastic and complex components of stock prediction.
