            "Posted on: 2024-07-11 15:11:13\n",
            "Content: 1. **Everyone makes mistakes. Just be sure to cut all losses short.** Even the best investors get hit with a loss from time to time. But they don't indulge in worry as the stock drops even further. They [cut their losses quickly](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/when-to-sell-growth-stocks-number-1-rule/) and move on. Leave your ego and pride at the door. Don't let a loss get to you — either mentally or financially.\n",
            "2. **If you don't sell too early, you'll sell too late.** To lock in solid gains, sell while your stock is still going up. As IBD founder William J. O'Neil has said, \"Your objective is to make and take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy, or emotionally carried away as your stock's advance gets stronger.\" Following the [20%-25% sell rule](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-build-long-term-profits-in-stocks-take-many-gains-at-20-25/) can help you do that. In a strong bull market, leading growth stocks like Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft and Apple can, of course, run longer than expected. But locking in some profits along the way allows investors to safeguard a portion of those gains, while still maintaining a position to take advantage of a continued run. It also reduces the risk of giving back too much in an extended pullback.\n",
            "3. **Have a sell plan in place** ***before*** **you buy.** The real drama kicks in when it comes time to sell. If you don't have sell rules and an exit plan, it's easy to freeze and not take action when needed. If your stock is soaring, you might get greedy and ignore certain sell signals and warning signs. Also, if you're sitting on a loss, you may do the \"hold and hope\" routine. You pray it bounces back — while it continues to drop. Stay grounded and keep your emotions at bay by having a selling plan in place ahead of time. Write down your target sell prices for both taking profits and cutting losses.\n",
            "4. **Don't let a decent gain turn into a loss.** If you have a nice gain of, say, 10%, 15% or more and the stock begins to decline, don't let that profit disappear completely. It's much less frustrating to see a 15%-20% gain turn into a 5%-10% profit than to see it turn into a 10% loss. You can always buy the stock back if it shows renewed strength and forms a proper [buy point](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/chart-reading-basics-how-a-buy-point-marks-a-time-of-opportunity/).\n",
            "5. **Don't marry your stocks. Just date them!** \"For better or for worse, for richer or for poorer\" is a noble and time-honored approach to marital fealty, but it's a bad idea when it comes to [investing in stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-investing-how-to-make-money-in-stock-3-key-factors). In most cases, it's better to take a good gain while you have it. And never hesitate to separate and protect yourself from a bad relationship if there are clear signs of trouble.\n",
            "6. **Sell your losing stocks first.** When building a winning basketball team, you wouldn't trade away all your top players for a bunch of benchwarmers. Yet many investors do just that. They sell stocks in which they have a good gain and hold those showing a loss. Further, they think a big gain is just around the corner. That's usually just wishful thinking. Do the opposite. Sell your losers and use that money — provided the [market trend](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends) is favorable — to add winners to your roster or invest more money in the top performers you already own.\n",
            "7. **When buying a stock, focus on both the fundamentals and the stock chart. When selling, focus on the chart.** They say the view is great at the top, and that often applies to stocks as well. The warning signs typically show up in the [stock chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis) — i.e., [technical analysis](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/technical-analysis/) — before they appear in the company's fundamentals. It's crucial to use both technical and fundamental analysis when [buying stocks](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/how-to-buy-stocks-using-stock-lists-stock-ratings-stock-screener). The same is true on deciding when to sell stocks. Focus on the chart and technical analysis, like [price and volume](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/stock-chart-analysis-study-volume-in-bases/) action and behavior around key [moving averages](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-help-understand-stock-markets-direction-heres-how-to-use-them/).\n",
            "8. **The most important sell rule is to buy at the right time.** A very common mistake, particularly for [beginning investors](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-investing-how-to-make-money-in-stock-3-key-factors), is buying at the wrong time. Some will not pay attention to [market timing](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-market-timing-how-to-invest-in-stocks-tracking-bull-markets-bear-markets-stock-market-trends) and buy during a market correction when most stocks go down. Or they'll ignore the technical action in the [stock chart](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-charts-buying-stocks-using-technical-analysis) and either buy too soon or too late. So before buying a stock, make sure [three key factors](https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/stock-investing-how-to-make-money-in-stock-3-key-factors) — market trend, big earnings driven by something new, and institutional support — are in place.

If we add that to all the volatility and news that have been negatively affecting the whole market, it seems logical to me that we're gonna likely see a lot of sell offs, because it all induced lots of fear in people. It doesn't matter if you have faith in NVDA's future, a lot of ppl are very volatile and easily panic selling.\n",

When a major tech stock’s earnings (MSFT for example) don’t hit, it is assumed that Nvidia’s growth has hit a ceiling or that the “AI bubble” has burst. Now with AMD’s earnings there has been a slight realization that MSFT, Google, etc are not indicators of Nvidia. I believe Nvidia will continue to dominate and exceed expectations in a world where AI chips, data centers, cloud computing, and tech innovation are what is needed and Nvidia sets the bar. \n",

As I mentioned last week, there was every possibility of NVDA going all the way down to $90 a share even.  But that won't change the fact that once the correction ends, a monster rally of epic proportions will begin.\n",

            "The first and most important thing any investor in any stock should know is that stocks do not trade in a vacuum. Virtually all stocks are directionally correlated with the broad market indices. As goes the NASDAQ, so goes NVDA. This entire sell-off we've seen in NVDA is almost exclusively due to the correction in the NASDAQ-100. And that correction is nearing an end. The typical NASDAQ-100 correction runs roughly 15-20 trading sessions and the average correction size is 10%. We're now at 19 trading session and \\~14% off the highs on the NASDAQ-100.\n",
            "\n",
            "The NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) peaked at $503.50 only 19 trading days ago. At the lows of overnight trading, the QQQ hit $424 a share! That's down about 16% from its highs intraday to lows in premarket (not typically counted though).\n",

            "NVDA, by comparison, was trading at $135 a share 19-days ago and is down about 28% from its all-time highs. That makes sense given that NVDA trading at a much much higher beta to the market. The NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) rallies 10% and NVDA goes up 25%. It drops 12% and NVDA is going to drop 30%. That's just how it goes.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is no different than when NVDA fell from $970 down to a low of $750 back in April on the 8.2% NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) correction. Just like now, that 22% drop in NVDA had very little to do with NVDA and everything to do with the broad market sell-off.\n",
            "\n",
            "Eventually, the NASDAQ-100 will bottom and continue higher in this secular bull market we're in. NVDA will be a significant beneficiary of new money coming into the market and will likely surge to $150 a share by the time we arrive at the New Year. In all honesty, it'll probably happen a lot sooner than that. Once the NASDAQ-100 bottoms -- and we really aren't that far from that point -- the entire market will go on a gut wrenching rally and will likely reach all time highs within 30-40 trading sessions. That's like two months time. NVDA probably gets up to $130-$140 by late September to late October as a result.\n",

Length of trend being one, with only one day difference between the two. Percentage of pullback is similar as well. Also our close out on Friday brought the share price just back within the long term ascending channel. It’s righttttt on the line, but it’s close enough that come Monday it could find itself back within the channel. \n",

            "Content: As 4080 super hit around 1000€ in Europe I am looking into upgrade for 4k gaming. Amd does not come into play beacuse I use gpu for ML too. So is it worth it the upgrade for 4k gaming. I can run all games at 4k with 3070ti at 60fps (ratchet and clank, spiderman these games can crash from time to time(read it could be bad optimization of games))  and 120fps (lol, cs2, ori, hades..). I saw some other treads recommending to wait for 50xx series but thise were mostly for 1080p and 1440p. I could sell my 3070ti msi gaming trio x for 350-400€ here. Any suggestions or experiences?\n",

In between Intel stock rose to $60.  Ten years of stock buybacks at inflated prices were a waste. Those billions should have been saved for a rainy day because semiconductor industry business cycles are measured in decades not years. Existing semiconductor companies should remind the market of this massive failure of capital allocation when being pressured by W$ twits.  Much of the blame for value destroying share buybacks should be placed on the Intel board and the CFOs. \n",

            "Both \"PC/DC\" business and Foundry are floundering and interestingly enough they both need each other to stay alive. \"PC/DC\"  is the majority of the volume in Intel's fabs! If PC/DC decamps for TSMC that would inevitably sink Intel Foundry before it gets off the ground.  Intel Foundry currently has worse products than TSMC and PC/DC can’t really use all the benefits of TSMC.   Because these 2 organizations need each other they are making poor short-term and long-term decisions.Intel also has a huge culture of consensus building and that is leading to slow decision making and increased bureaucracy. These groups need to function independently and Pat needs to drive P&L ownership down further into the organization. There are a lot of complexities around transfer pricing, etc.   But Intel's current culture of everyone talks to everyone isn't working.\n",

As of March 2024 Intel had approximately 130K full-time employees.  If they reduce their workforce by 18K employees that is \\~14% reduction in force (RIF).  Note that Intel is primarily a manufacturing company and the majority of their workers are working in Wafer-Fabs (WF) or Assembly/Testing (AT).  If they are seeing volumes dry-up that means that factory workers will be either laid-off or hours will be cut. Assuming Intel wants to have 110K employees after their RIF that means about 10K for the main business units (IP block design, PC, DataCenter, Altera, Networking, etc.) and 100K for the Foundry related operations.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Solution(s):  **Immediately separate the Foundry organization from IP/PC/DC.**  Put IP/PC/DC in one set of buildings and Foundry in another set of buildings. Give people different emails, don’t allow HR transfers between the two, have different compensation schemes, etc. This would be super challenging to pull off, but it would enable faster decision making and increase SVP/VP accountability.  Rather than a blanket 15% RIF separate out the organizations and let the leaders decide who to cull.\n",

These groups need to function independently and Pat needs to drive P&L ownership down further into the organization.

As of March 2024 Intel had approximately 130K full-time employees.  If they reduce their workforce by 18K employees that is \\~14% reduction in force (RIF).  Note that Intel is primarily a manufacturing company and the majority of their workers are working in Wafer-Fabs (WF) or Assembly/Testing (AT).  If they are seeing volumes dry-up that means that factory workers will be either laid-off or hours will be cut. Assuming Intel wants to have 110K employees after their RIF that means about 10K for the main business units (IP block design, PC, DataCenter, Altera, Networking, etc.) and 100K for the Foundry related operations.  \n",

            "\n",
            "A little background: I was an Intel bear from 2018 to 2024. The reason to have been bearish on the worst semiconductor stock over the past 10 years has been pretty obvious. Intel messed up their manufacturing; they had a 2-3 year lead over TSMC on node technology for over 20 years. But a series of mistakes, 10nm (now Intel 7), and messed-up 7nm (now Intel 4) led to a huge gap with their fabless competition. This allowed Nvidia and AMD, who design chips using software (Cadence and Synopsys) that follow design IP rules set by TSMC, to produce and package the chips.\n",
            "\n",
            "Intel turned a lead into a 2-year gap. The previous CEO, in 2020, bought TSMC capacity at 3nm to hedge the possibility that Intel would fail again and to allow their products to be more competitive until the foundry side caught up.\n",
            "\n",
            "This has led to where we are today. Intel Foundry has low utilization due to outsourcing for next year and is producing uneconomic products, leading to a cash burn. While Intel products for the past 4 years have sold uncompetitive chips.\n",
            "\n",
            "But investing is about the future; you are buying today and not the past. So what is coming that will change the story?\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's deal with the product side of the business first. Right now, the vast majority of Intel products are uncompetitive, which leads to lower volume and lower ASPs. That is changing come the end of this year. Intel products will have Lunar Lake (TSMC 3nm) ultra-low power mobile CPU, and Arrow Lake (TSMC 3nm) desktop and mobile CPU. By all accounts, these products will be extremely competitive and are actually on a superior node to AMD (TSMC 4nm). As the volume of these products ramps up in Q4, Intel ASPs and volume will slowly rise.\n",
            "\n",
            "Intel also has data center CPUs coming into volume this year: Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids using the Intel 3 node. These products close the gap with AMD in the data center but do not surpass them.\n",
            "Next year, Intel products will have Panther Lake (Intel 18A) low-power mobile CPU and Clearwater Forest (Intel 18A) Data Center CPU, which should jump ahead of AMD. There's also a data center GPU, Falcon Shores, but there’s little information on it, so I'm not going to speculate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some of you might be asking how I compare TSMC 3nm, Intel 3, Intel 18A, etc. To keep it simple, Intel uses PPA (power, performance, and area) to name its nodes in comparison to TSMC. In general, you should think of nodes as having two factors: density and PPA. TSMC has a comfortable density lead, which helps generally in lower power, and higher PPA is generally better for HPC chips (CPUs). Intel 3 has been documented to have a lower density than TSMC 3nm but a similar PPA. Intel intends to catch up with density on Intel 18A next year to TSMC 3nm and have a lead with PPA vs TSMC 2nm/3nm node.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now to Intel Foundry's business. Intel Foundry is losing money due to the vast majority of their production being uncompetitive nodes and having much lower volume than in the past since Intel is outsourcing some production to TSMC. Sometime next year, Intel Foundry will begin to see a shift to Intel 18A. This comes with a 3x higher selling price per wafer vs. current nodes. Incremental volume will return to Intel Foundry as Intel shifts back to Intel Foundry from TSMC. Just as Intel products will slowly start to see rising ASPs at the end of this year, you can expect Intel Foundry to slowly climb out of the hole. Each quarter next year, as Intel 18A ramps up will lead to lower losses. Intel also wants external customers and has some booked, with Microsoft being the largest single customer. Intel Foundry is competing against TSMC, whose similar node to 18A is their 2nm. TSMC 2nm will ramp up at the end of 2025 and won’t have real products until sometime in 2026. This gives Intel a nice window to demonstrate to potential customers that 18A is competitive and has good yields. For a follow-on node of 14A using ASML High NA. Intel does not expect to be #1 Foundry by volume, nor do they have to be with its current valuation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately the biggest downside is Intel messes up 18A. Then I would sell, and buy $AMD. I think over the next 3 years. Intel can be north of $100 a share. The semiconductor industry operates with a large lag, Intel's current results are being driven by decisions made in early 2021. There is a lot more I could write about, but I don't want this to be too long. Let me know in comments, if you are interested.\n",

These crashes happen minimum 3 times a day. For a while I thought it was my AMD GPU, an RX 7900XTX (because of all the stigma around AMD drivers + every time I'd get a crash, the AMD crash tool would open and say \"we notice you had a driver timeout\" or something along those lines), but now with these new videos from Level1Tech and the GamerNexus videos, it might actually be my CPU.

            "The AC load line value is way too high in many BIOS'es and \"Intel Baseline\" profiles. Values of 0.9 mOhm or even Intel maximum stated value of 1.1 mOhm. This has also been the case before all the BETA BIOS'es with Intel spec profiles showed up. High AC load line value will put your Vcore at 1.5-1.6V and can degrade your CPU in a couple months time. Especially at higher temperatures under load. You need to lower this value until your Vcore is within safe ranges again.  \n",
            "My rule of thumb is never exceed 1.5Vcore. 14700K and 14900K do not need that much anyway, most chips can run way lower and still be stable. Mine have been running fine and that's why people who undervolted from the very start, probably have no issues unless it's an unlucky batch with via oxidation or just usual QC slip through that can happen.\n",

This BIOS update is a good thing to have for added safety. **Please be aware that currently, if you disable the default Intel BIOS profile (\"Performance\" or \"Extreme\") the 0x129 voltage cap** ***does NOT seem to work on at least some motherboards*** ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOvJAHhQKZg)). I think we should assume this is how it works across all motherboards. My advice remains the same: undervolt as hard as you can, set IA VR Voltage Limit to 1400mV to be safe. If you do not have IA VR Voltage Limit available, either 1) simply just run the default Intel profile and accept the higher temperatures and higher average voltages, or 2) undervolt hard via AC LL and/or offset(s).  \n",

            "\n",
            "**Q** I have tried everything in this thread, even underclocked my CPU! I cannot get this chip to stabilize and stop crashing?  \n",
            "**A** Unfortunately, your chip is smoked. If it doesn't even run any of the Intel Baseline default profiles, it's time to contact Intel for RMA. Check your WHEA logger in Windows as it is probably full of ID19 errors and copy-paste that to Intel.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q** WHEA ID19 means my chip is broken?  \n",
            "**A** No, not always. WHEA errors can also point to an unstable undervolt. Sometimes that would flag ID19, other times it can flag specific core numbers that crashed due to too low voltage. When your undervolt is *almost* stable enough, you might not always crash hard (BSOD) but only get WHEA errors, or games crash to desktop without error. It is good practice to always test true Intel spec defaults for stability, as a baseline before you move to undervolting.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q** I can't enter the AC LL value in my ASUS BIOS, it says \"AUTO\" and is greyed out?!  \n",
            "**A** Simply highlight or select that box and start typing. It's a little counter-intuitive.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q** My Vcore is already within an acceptable range, it seems. Do I need to take action?  \n",
            "**A** Realize that a basic undervolt is not hard to do at all and it only brings advantages with it for very little time investment. Also, realize that software sensors do not see ultra short transient voltage spikes, they can still go well over the maximum Vcore value your software registered. Set an IA VR Voltage Limit (if available), so the CPU no longer requests any insane voltages. You will also need to do this even if you have the new 0x129 microcode but disabled any default intel BIOS profile. Disabling intel default profiles also disables the 0x129 functionality. If you do not want to undervolt and/or have no IA VR Voltage Limit and feel paranoid about this all, please just simply run an Intel default profile and accept the less than efficient temperatures and voltages.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q** Why do we need to destroy performance on our Intel 13/14th gen to be stable or safe?  \n",
            "**A** Undervolting does not lower performance. Leaving IA CEP on when undervolting can destroy performance, so disable that. If anything, undervolting actually improves performance by freeing up new thermal headroom for the CPU to clock higher again.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q** I have disabled IA CEP and I think I'm still losing performance?  \n",
            "**A** Most likely, your *average* VID's are way higher than your *average* Vcore *under load.* Please check this and adjust the DC loadline according to this guide. VID's are used for CPU package power calculation, so when VID's are higher than Vcore, the CPU will think it needs to throttle at your specific powerlimit, while actual power usage (watts) isn't even that high yet. Keep Vcore and VID's within +/- 0.03V or better.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Q** I have a question and/or tip, can I DM you?  \n",
            "**A** Absolutely. But please do your due diligence first and read this guide, try to understand the concepts. This goes beyond the whole Intel issues at play and will serve you for future undervolts as well. Other than that, I am absolutely happy to help you out and receive any feedback you have.\n",

            "\n",
            "A little background: I was an Intel bear from 2018 to 2024. The reason to have been bearish on the worst semiconductor stock over the past 10 years has been pretty obvious. Intel messed up their manufacturing; they had a 2-3 year lead over TSMC on node technology for over 20 years. But a series of mistakes, 10nm (now Intel 7), and messed-up 7nm (now Intel 4) led to a huge gap with their fabless competition. This allowed Nvidia and AMD, who design chips using software (Cadence and Synopsys) that follow design IP rules set by TSMC, to produce and package the chips.\n",
            "\n",
            "Intel turned a lead into a 2-year gap. The previous CEO, in 2020, bought TSMC capacity at 3nm to hedge the possibility that Intel would fail again and to allow their products to be more competitive until the foundry side caught up.\n",
            "\n",
            "This has led to where we are today. Intel Foundry has low utilization due to outsourcing for next year and is producing uneconomic products, leading to a cash burn. While Intel products for the past 4 years have sold uncompetitive chips.\n",
            "\n",
            "But investing is about the future; you are buying today and not the past. So what is coming that will change the story?\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's deal with the product side of the business first. Right now, the vast majority of Intel products are uncompetitive, which leads to lower volume and lower ASPs. That is changing come the end of this year. Intel products will have Lunar Lake (TSMC 3nm) ultra-low power mobile CPU, and Arrow Lake (TSMC 3nm) desktop and mobile CPU. By all accounts, these products will be extremely competitive and are actually on a superior node to AMD (TSMC 4nm). As the volume of these products ramps up in Q4, Intel ASPs and volume will slowly rise.\n",
            "\n",
            "Intel also has data center CPUs coming into volume this year: Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids using the Intel 3 node. These products close the gap with AMD in the data center but do not surpass them.\n",
            "Next year, Intel products will have Panther Lake (Intel 18A) low-power mobile CPU and Clearwater Forest (Intel 18A) Data Center CPU, which should jump ahead of AMD. There's also a data center GPU, Falcon Shores, but there’s little information on it, so I'm not going to speculate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some of you might be asking how I compare TSMC 3nm, Intel 3, Intel 18A, etc. To keep it simple, Intel uses PPA (power, performance, and area) to name its nodes in comparison to TSMC. In general, you should think of nodes as having two factors: density and PPA. TSMC has a comfortable density lead, which helps generally in lower power, and higher PPA is generally better for HPC chips (CPUs). Intel 3 has been documented to have a lower density than TSMC 3nm but a similar PPA. Intel intends to catch up with density on Intel 18A next year to TSMC 3nm and have a lead with PPA vs TSMC 2nm/3nm node.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now to Intel Foundry's business. Intel Foundry is losing money due to the vast majority of their production being uncompetitive nodes and having much lower volume than in the past since Intel is outsourcing some production to TSMC. Sometime next year, Intel Foundry will begin to see a shift to Intel 18A. This comes with a 3x higher selling price per wafer vs. current nodes. Incremental volume will return to Intel Foundry as Intel shifts back to Intel Foundry from TSMC. Just as Intel products will slowly start to see rising ASPs at the end of this year, you can expect Intel Foundry to slowly climb out of the hole. Each quarter next year, as Intel 18A ramps up will lead to lower losses. Intel also wants external customers and has some booked, with Microsoft being the largest single customer. Intel Foundry is competing against TSMC, whose similar node to 18A is their 2nm. TSMC 2nm will ramp up at the end of 2025 and won’t have real products until sometime in 2026. This gives Intel a nice window to demonstrate to potential customers that 18A is competitive and has good yields. For a follow-on node of 14A using ASML High NA. Intel does not expect to be #1 Foundry by volume, nor do they have to be with its current valuation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately the biggest downside is Intel messes up 18A. Then I would sell, and buy $AMD. I think over the next 3 years. Intel can be north of $100 a share. The semiconductor industry operates with a large lag, Intel's current results are being driven by decisions made in early 2021. There is a lot more I could write about, but I don't want this to be too long. Let me know in comments, if you are interested.\n",

I think he wanted to buy like August Monthly puts for INTC at $21 and I said I thought that move was crazy and the market had already priced in a bottoming out for him.  I suggested he buy the $30 puts instead.  Turns out he maybe should have just stuck to his gut.  But hopefully he made the move and made some money.  \n",

Whoever was buying the previous couple days is done with their positioning bc the volume fell off and dropped.  We lost a little of our upwards buying support and the momentum fell off.

It doesn't solve the AI GPU problem but for the DC CPU business this could be a problem.  Ultimately its about parity and as one of the big three, I think eventually the gov't is going to step in and regulate cloud servers as a utility.  That means the gov't won't allow there to be a monopoly of just one kind of chip in the servers and will require no favoritism.  If AMZN tries to raise the prices on AMD/INTC servers and offer discount prices on their own servers ESPECIALLY if their product is inferior, well that's all the gov't is going to need to be open season.\n",

It's another new entry into the marketplace which could offer us some problems down the road but I don't see it massively impacting our DC business in the next 2-3 years.  They also haven't really released the specs and let people get in and use it to do some benchmarking.  So could be fools gold too and the first entry in might be rouggggggggggggh and only be optimized for very very specific applications.  I was expecting AMD to overreact to this news bc of course we do right??? Just sort of our MO to go double down on every bad news and never go up on good news lol.\n",

I do think that NVDA will probably beat and raise and it will help provide a catalyst for us to take off into the fall.  BTW I love how NVDA announces shit and now they look like they actually might see some delay in Blackwell.  Jensen doesn't care.  He will just sell more H100s.

I bet they would come after INTC if it wasn't already such a dumpster fire.  I kinda feel like this legal action AFTER the fact isn't a good thing.  The damage is already done.  There isn't a lot of room in the world for alternative search products other than Goog.  They are a day late and a dollar short.

AMD seems sort of detached from the Macro at the moment and we are just sort of doing our own thing.  I think we've got the benefit of the dumpster fire which is INTC but I think NVDA earnings are going to show just how far we are falling behind in the AI race.  I don't think we have threaded that winner and I think we might still have another leg down.  I'm looking for AMD to Rally up into the $140s and maybe even test that 200 day EMA at $151 before we fail and take the next leg down.  I'm not a buyer here.  I think I'm gonna get it cheaper.  I'm looking to Buy AMD closer to $120 and I think we could see some divergence from NVDA earnings.  I already have some long shares but I'm not adding here.

That means that the Fed's tools are limited and it really comes back down to can we get some assistance in the fight against inflation from Congress?

And I think we really only need just a couple more days to hold on for this to work.  But alas I'm not sure that this will happen.  TSM earnings are 7/18 and that should boost the entire sector with some positive numbers but the real meat and potatoes doesn't hit until August.  \n",

Some people are saying this is year 2 of a 5 year growth cycle and I think that kinda lines up.  1st year was all hype, this is the second year, which means year 3-4 should be delivering on the promise and year 5 ramp down into next iteration.  So looking at a long term view, I think dip-buying AMD is the smart move but that means targets.\n",
            "\n",
            "I love that AMD finally broke out and got above that $175ish level that has been a resistance point.  And we held that level as well.  We are getting some love and PT upgrades mainly bc we aren't named NVDA and were approaching value level compared to everyone else in the AI trade.  Same thing with INTC which isn't always a list you want to be on but it is what it is.  The thing about AMD is that if you stick to your price targets, it almost ALWAYS gives you a good entry point.  For me on my chart above, I'm looking at a supply zone that is roughly within 5% of the 200 day EMA as the best place to buy.  Anything above that is great but you've missed the run.  So while it is reallllllly cool we are up here, I'm not a buyer at this point and don't think you should chase this run.  Like I said, I went short and some shares might be getting called away for me so I will be looking to get back in in a big way.  \n",

Omnitrace is a new multi-purpose analysis tool for profiling and tracong both on the CPU and GPU(s). The rocPyDecode package is for accessing ROCm's rocDecode APIs from the Python programming language. Lastly ROCprofiler-SDK is for profiling and tracing for HIP and ROCm applications. \n",

There is also better PyTorch support with v2.2/v2.3 enabled and TensorFlow integration now working for TensorFlow 2.16. ROCm PyTorch support also includes support now for Autocast as the automatic mixed precision mode. There is also optimized native framework support introduced for OpenCLX.   \n",

            "ROCm 6.2 further provides memory savings for the \"bitsandbytes\" model quantization, improves vLLM support and enhances performance tuning for AMD Instinct accelerators. On the vLLM side there is now FP16 and BF16 precision for large language models and FP8 support is working for Llama. There is additional work around multi-GPU execution and other refinements in vLLM support.   \n",

The bottom is dropping out over there and I think them falling firmly below the 50 day EMA signals that potentially we could be looking at a revisit to sub $100 levels again.

VIX is exploding to the upside and I think the market is going to be ready for a decent little haircut.  Ehhhhhh I'm unsure about my LEAP strategy and I'm waiting a bit.  I snagged a couple yesterday no problems.  I got one at $155 and one at $150 which is great for me but I might pause here bc I might be getting $120 in a bit.  If we explode to the upside and have a great earnings then great! I'm already long but I think a recalibration is in sorts for this market.

So for us, our one hope in some positive movement is that we can have a bottoming out going into it.  If we get below that 200 day EMA and that $150 supply zone going into earnings, then that might be the catalyst we need to really get some massive move from AMD.  \n",

Projections from Lisa was always that AI sales numbers were going to start coming in larger and larger waves into the 2H of the year so here we are.  But I could see someone saying this earnings is still last quarter and we don't see the sales.  You know Lisa hates to report booking #s.  Only shipped product.  So I'm just concerned here.

I think September could be a good rally month for the market and there might be some movement from the FED which will provide some short term cash and optimism into the market.

That is why TSM is pumping higher today on the backs of upgrades and new demand by AAPL.  It's pulling the entire semi market up with it.

It would have to be at like $97 to hit oversold on RSI and I doubt thats going to be a thing.  But I do think that we might seem some broadening dip after AMD earnings.  But perhaps just for a moment bc we've got ARM the very very next day.  So if there is a window, its going to be incredibly tight.

There is a MASSIVE call wall that starts at $160 and goes all the way to $185 and then the spec buys at $200.

If we have no problem protecting oil fields in Saudia Arabia, then we DEFINITELY should be protecting the Chip Fabs in Taiwan.  It is a natural resource that powers our economy at this point.  Our support for them against China has NEVER really been a point of contention and I see firsthand how much China is trying to push the expansionism in that region of the world.  A LOT of the workers that I work with are in the Philippines and they are literally on the verge of a hot war over disputed shoals and economic zone's that China is just now claiming as its own.

Sure we dipped but buyers really did step back in at that $175ish level of previous resistance which is EXACTLY what we wanted to see going into earnings.  Earnings were confirmed at the end of the month which seems soon but hey I'll take it.  So I was expecting there to be a rollover and pullback but was hoping for it to hold this level and do a sideways move as the market sort of took profits with the AI trade and we saw some broadening out.  We've run up a bit so us not broadening out and remaining flat was part of my thesis.  A major presidential candidate can definitely throw a wrench into those plans.\n",

At the time of this writing, AMD is looking to shed A LOT along with every other TSMC customer if there is any potential question of the security of those chip pipelines which is throwing a lot of cold water on this trade.  That means things are going to accelerate losses from here which is not the time we want to see a big selloff.  Now (tinfoil hat time) Trump says a lot of bat shit crazy things that his campaign and surrogates then walk back.  I know they are going through the anointing ritual right now but his new VP pick could not be a bigger anti-China buff.  So I'm assuming he will immediately quell rumors and commit to supporting Taiwan.  Translation: this little dip could be short lived and an opportunity.  \n",

But AMD selloff could get ugly real fast.  We are set to gap down but I think I can confidently say that gap will fill going into earnings.  A shakeout here isn't the WORST thing going into earnings and could reset our RSI a bit to take the next leg up.  But it definitely will kill the enthusiasm of this rally and probably take out our potential for a new run up to ATH's unless we get a LOT of walk back talk in the next couple of days.  I was hoping to buy some LEAPs before earnings and welllllp now I definitely will be able to do that lol.  \n",

My breakeven would want to be $185 which means I need to buy them and sell calls to get my premium paid down to $1500 which is doable now.  The pullback should potentially put that into play.  I think I can swing that now.  The big question now is where do we stop?  Time in the market is better than trying to time the market so yea for me I'm a big big fan of us being closer to that 50 day EMA around $166ish on my chart as an entry.  I think its batshit crazy that we are looking at this massive pullback just off of this news so I think the pullback will be hard and fast.  That's my strategy.  Thoughts?  \n",

It is a completely different approach from NVDA's walled garden approach.  And trust me, their garden is beautiful.  Who wouldn't want to play in there.  But this is more a strategy of knocking down the walls.  Who knows, there may be some new opensource AI GPU code that emerges from this that becomes the dominant GPU OS for all future GPU development for not just AMD but any other new entry as well bc its built on available Opensource code that anyone can use.

But when you really let that sink in, that means that they are also seeing the cracks and think we will be in full on economic meltdown for that to occur.  That means that the Fed's tools are limited and it really comes back down to can we get some assistance in the fight against inflation from Congress?  And honestly ugggh whoever wins, both parties are proposing additional spending that isn't paid for which will make inflation worse.  So I think the market kinda rallied on the initial comment and then really started to think about what it meant.\n",

That $175 level of former resistance needs to act like support going into earnings for us to really hold onto the breakout and confirm the move higher.  And I think we really only need just a couple more days to hold on for this to work.  But alas I'm not sure that this will happen.  TSM earnings are 7/18 and that should boost the entire sector with some positive numbers but the real meat and potatoes doesn't hit until August.  \n",

But at the same time there does appear to be some broadening out of the tech trade away from that Mag 7 stocks and seeing more people move into a larger basket of value.

We hit oversold on our RSI and our MACD looks like its ready to start rolling over.  But I think earnings coming up is going to be a positive catalyst.  I might attempt to buy a little spec options if we dip into the $175s.

I wonder if there is any significance there.  I used to use INTC as a barometer of the PC markets health bc of their legacy contracts that keep them afloat.  But I don't think you can do the same inversely and use AMD to reflect PC health.  AMD has a much much better CPU product than this generation of INTC CPU's so I don't think we necessarily influence there decision here.\n",

Looking through the read the gaming sector is just a graveyard of dead GPU's and might be worthwhile us exiting the market unless we can find some parity with NVDA.  Unfortunately there are a lot of carryovers between gaming and AI GPU design so I'm not sure we exit completely.  NCAA College Football is EVERYWHERE and it is a console exclusive.

MSFT missed bc their AI solutions are 100% sold out and they can't get enough supply.  The supply constraints are hitting the cloud providers and that is going to give us pricing power for sure going forward.

Soooo the only difference is we are looking at a rate cut potentially form the Fed and the market is optimistic after another jobs miss which will inject some liquidity into the market.

So I think the market is starting to slow down a bit after that initial hype as people develop use cases.  There was a lot of initial first to market products that were flashy and did things, but really they were technology demonstrators.  And now the real work is happening behind the scenes to develop the models and programs that will actually shape the future at scale.  Sometime's first to market isn't always the optimal set up.  Tesla wasn't the first electric car developed but they instead tried to change the experience by making the car feel like a luxury product etc etc......  So we are in a new phase of cycle here.\n",

So could we be at the very very early beginning of an AI growth cycle-----absolutely?  Some people are saying this is year 2 of a 5 year growth cycle and I think that kinda lines up.  1st year was all hype, this is the second year, which means year 3-4 should be delivering on the promise and year 5 ramp down into next iteration.  So looking at a long term view, I think dip-buying AMD is the smart move but that means targets.\n",

We are getting some love and PT upgrades mainly bc we aren't named NVDA and were approaching value level compared to everyone else in the AI trade.  Same thing with INTC which isn't always a list you want to be on but it is what it is.  The thing about AMD is that if you stick to your price targets, it almost ALWAYS gives you a good entry point.  For me on my chart above, I'm looking at a supply zone that is roughly within 5% of the 200 day EMA as the best place to buy.  Anything above that is great but you've missed the run.  So while it is reallllllly cool we are up here, I'm not a buyer at this point and don't think you should chase this run.  Like I said, I went short and some shares might be getting called away for me so I will be looking to get back in in a big way.  \n",

I feel like if there really is some concern, we could do the same thing and Taiwan is not an absolute cluster fuck of a country, I'm sure they could handle a massive influx of weapon systems and ammunition without problems.  Soooooooo Zooooooming out to the next 5 years, I gotta say I don't think there is as big of a risk to Taiwan as the market is making. If anything, you might argue that comments like that could make it MORE LIKELY that Taiwan gets a lot more military support in the near term bc he put it clearly in the crosshairs.

It wasn't just regular market dynamics that triggered the selling.  But the market was primed for this pullback in tech.  Everyone and their mom has been talking about things getting ahead of itself.  How what like 70% of the gains in the SP have come this year from like 5 stocks.  It just wasn't sustainable and I was expecting something like this but I was expecting that market cracks would turn to full on breaks before the Fed acted (bc they are always late) and that would trigger a 25% haircut.

Good news is we are officially back into my buy zone.  Again I'm a swing trader and I love that 200 day EMA as a purchase point.  We saw a nice bounce off of right near it yesterday and the support lined up with our lows from before this recent rally took off.  So for those of you who have been asking where would I buy----This is the place.  I would not advise that you buy everything right now.  As this could go lower.  But DCA yourself into a position.

But if I can get those options even lower at around $32-$35 then I think that is where I would feel REALLY REALLY comfortable.  So I'm hoping for a little dip but I think I want to buy into that area at roughly $32.00 ideally.  Thoughts???/ Anyone pouring over the options chains for LEAPs and see something I'm missing?  There's a little bit of a call wall that is starting to form at $180 on the option chain with almost 6k in options sold so thats where I'm looking at.

I wonder if there is any significance there.  I used to use INTC as a barometer of the PC markets health bc of their legacy contracts that keep them afloat.

The bottom is dropping out over there and I think them falling firmly below the 50 day EMA signals that potentially we could be looking at a revisit to sub $100 levels again.

VIX is exploding to the upside and I think the market is going to be ready for a decent little haircut.  Ehhhhhh I'm unsure about my LEAP strategy and I'm waiting a bit.  I snagged a couple yesterday no problems.  I got one at $155 and one at $150 which is great for me but I might pause here bc I might be getting $120 in a bit.

It doesn't solve the AI GPU problem but for the DC CPU business this could be a problem.  Ultimately its about parity and as one of the big three, I think eventually the gov't is going to step in and regulate cloud servers as a utility.  That means the gov't won't allow there to be a monopoly of just one kind of chip in the servers and will require no favoritism.

I personally do not think they have fully exhausted the selling pressure on this stock.  Or really the entire semi sector for that matter.  NVDA gained above that key level and bounced off of its 50 day EMA which is has been riding and holding strong with some relative strength but it honestly looked like it was going for a gap fill from the initial drop.  I just don't think that a pullback in NVDA has even begun until we get bellow that 50 day EMA there at $116.  As goes NVDA............goes the rest of the Semi market.\n",

Not flawless but we started behind the 8-ball and a lot of what we have been doing is responding to NVDA instead of out front leading.  But we are making strides and gains in the right places and building momentum where it needs to be.  We may not be a Ferrari but we are turning into the GM of the auto world.  Sure we made some shit products back in the day and were the cheap option but now we turn out quality products and the volume is there.  We are a behemoth but one that is still innovating and not stagnate like INTC.  We have the leadership situation solved which is traditionally the hardest thing in the world to find.\n",

I hope they knock it out of the park and my LEAPs become super expensive bc that would be great for my overall portfolio.  But I also know that usually there is a ramp up, and then a BIG ramp down with AMD before it begins to digest the news bc people are playing some sort of NVDA moonshot potential with options around earnings and we never seem to get that.  I still want my $160 at $32-$35 but I'm starting to do work on other strike prices and see if I can make it work.  $150 is intriguing especially around that $37 range.  I'm not sure if there will be any confluence between those two strikes and their prices but if there are, I think I might split my purchase between the two.  \n",

If the lead time has been reasonbly steady then when AMD gave numbers in the last call they probably still would have had around 2/3 of Q4 MI300X production volume available to be sold that would not have been in the full year projection. Going with that assumption and flat Q3 to Q4 production then (4-1.2) = 4/3 X gives us Q3=Q4=3(4-1.2)/4=2.1B and a grand total of 5.4B for the year (which can be announced in this CC because they are sold out).\n",

Using that as a trajectory to try to make the prediction is a mistake (one that I think Rolland at Susquehanna is making). To believe that you basically have to assume that AMD sold out nearly all their production for 2024 by the end of 2023 and barely added any orders as the year progressed (if you believe the current 6 month lead time).

As it stands now, the market does not appear to be rewarding companies for good earnings.  AMD has always seen the struggle bus after earnings to begin with.  So for us, our one hope in some positive movement is that we can have a bottoming out going into it.  If we get below that 200 day EMA and that $150 supply zone going into earnings, then that might be the catalyst we need to really get some massive move from AMD.  \n",

But I could see someone saying this earnings is still last quarter and we don't see the sales.  You know Lisa hates to report booking #s.  Only shipped product.  So I'm just concerned here.

I think September could be a good rally month for the market and there might be some movement from the FED which will provide some short term cash and optimism into the market.

If anything, you might argue that comments like that could make it MORE LIKELY that Taiwan gets a lot more military support in the near term bc he put it clearly in the crosshairs.

            "Per [artificialnalysis.ai](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/llama-3-1-instruct-405b/providers) which benchmarked various instances supporting Llama 3.1, Fireworks AI instances based on MI300 have the lowest cost per unit of performance. Since launch, other companies in the AI space have been discussing the merits of MI300 use with Llama 3.1. Lepton AI has followed Fireworks AI in offering Llama 3.1 platform using MI300 as can be seen from this post: [https://x.com/jiayq/status/1815900665958523237](https://x.com/jiayq/status/1815900665958523237)\n",
            "\n",
            "Software has been the Achilles heel of AMD GPUs adoption in the data center but that seems to be increasingly not the case. Having the new Llama models supported on day 1 is a testament to that.\n",
            "\n",
            "# As Software Improves, Hardware Strengths Become More Visible\n",
            "\n",
            "AMD has had strong GPUs for a couple of generations now but the lack of relevant AI software has been the limiter. With strong software support as discussed above, the hardware goodness is now starting to shine.\n",
            "\n",
            "We already know from Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT)) Build conference that MI300 does well when it comes to OpenAI’s GPT4 models. The main appeal of MI300 for GPT4 is a key hardware feature: large HBM size. This same advantage now extends to the open-source world via Llama 3.1.\n",
            "\n",
            "Open-source models have been gaining importance over time as they catch up in performance with proprietary models like GPT4o. Llama, in particular, has risen to the top in customer adoption with Zuckerberg predicting that it will become the #1 model in a short order. As a sign of Llama’s ascendency, Microsoft ([MSFT](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT)) Azure, Google ([GOOG](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG)) ([GOOGL](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL)) Cloud, Amazon ([AMZN](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN)) AWS are all offering Llama 3.1.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of the Llama 3.1 models, the biggest model with 405 billion parameters, is especially well suited to work with MI300. As can be seen from the image below, due to MI300’s large memory, the Llama 3.1 405B parameter model at default FP16 operands fits comfortably in an 8 node MI300 setup but it will take a 16 node Nvidia ([NVDA](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA)) H100 setup. Even with lower resolution FP8 operands, the model is a tight fit on H100.\n",

            "[Source](https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1816514154582130928)\n",
            "\n",
            "This means that customers opting to use Llama 3.1 405B, and there will be many of these, can save over 50% on hardware costs by using AMD MI300 instead of Nvidia H100. This development, especially the cost angle, may also meaningfully pressure hyperscalers to offer MI300 instances.\n",
            "\n",
            "AMD’s memory advantage is not transient and is set to continue. As discussed in the past articles, AMD’s MI300, MI325, and MI350 will compete favorably, especially in memory size, with H100, H200/B100, and B200.\n",
            "\n",
            "AMD’s memory advantage is set to become increasingly more important as AI models get bigger. With AMD being favorably positioned with OpenAI GPT models and Meta Llama models gaining widespread adoption, we can expect that MI300/325/350 share is likely to increase.\n",
            "\n",
            "# Bottom Line\n",
            "\n",
            "Concerns about AMD MI3xx ramp are misplaced. Whether the revenues in H2 will go to lofty levels or not, AMD’s GPU market share is set to grow as its products are fundamentally advantaged. It is crucial to note that the advantage holds with models from the top 2 AI houses – OpenAI and Meta. AMD’s GPU revenue is set to explode as the market realizes the cost benefit compared to Nvidia equivalents. As a result, investors and analysts are also likely to see considerable optimism from management on data center GPUs in the Q2 call.\n",
            "\n",
            "The setup for the stock is rarely better than it is going into Q2 earnings. The weak stock price is a great opportunity to accumulate AMD stock.\n",

As of right now, street consensus seems to be predicting a slowdown of revenue growth all the way to 9% in 2027 and then a rebound all the way to 23% growth in 2029, does anybody know why this is? I'm thinking it has something to do with their contracts but can not confirm. Any help appreciated, thank you. \n",

            "\n",
            "I know r/stocks sees a lot of Intel posts, but none of the ones I've seen really describe the Intel story or, frankly, misunderstand the semiconductor industry entirely.\n",
            "\n",
            "A little background: I was an Intel bear from 2018 to 2024. The reason to have been bearish on the worst semiconductor stock over the past 10 years has been pretty obvious. Intel messed up their manufacturing; they had a 2-3 year lead over TSMC on node technology for over 20 years. But a series of mistakes, 10nm (now Intel 7), and messed-up 7nm (now Intel 4) led to a huge gap with their fabless competition. This allowed Nvidia and AMD, who design chips using software (Cadence and Synopsys) that follow design IP rules set by TSMC, to produce and package the chips.\n",
            "\n",
            "Intel turned a lead into a 2-year gap. The previous CEO, in 2020, bought TSMC capacity at 3nm to hedge the possibility that Intel would fail again and to allow their products to be more competitive until the foundry side caught up.\n",
            "\n",
            "This has led to where we are today. Intel Foundry has low utilization due to outsourcing for next year and is producing uneconomic products, leading to a cash burn. While Intel products for the past 4 years have sold uncompetitive chips.\n",
            "\n",
            "But investing is about the future; you are buying today and not the past. So what is coming that will change the story?\n",
            "\n",
            "Let's deal with the product side of the business first. Right now, the vast majority of Intel products are uncompetitive, which leads to lower volume and lower ASPs. That is changing come the end of this year. Intel products will have Lunar Lake (TSMC 3nm) ultra-low power mobile CPU, and Arrow Lake (TSMC 3nm) desktop and mobile CPU. By all accounts, these products will be extremely competitive and are actually on a superior node to AMD (TSMC 4nm). As the volume of these products ramps up in Q4, Intel ASPs and volume will slowly rise.\n",
            "\n",
            "Intel also has data center CPUs coming into volume this year: Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids using the Intel 3 node. These products close the gap with AMD in the data center but do not surpass them.\n",
            "Next year, Intel products will have Panther Lake (Intel 18A) low-power mobile CPU and Clearwater Forest (Intel 18A) Data Center CPU, which should jump ahead of AMD. There's also a data center GPU, Falcon Shores, but there’s little information on it, so I'm not going to speculate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some of you might be asking how I compare TSMC 3nm, Intel 3, Intel 18A, etc. To keep it simple, Intel uses PPA (power, performance, and area) to name its nodes in comparison to TSMC. In general, you should think of nodes as having two factors: density and PPA. TSMC has a comfortable density lead, which helps generally in lower power, and higher PPA is generally better for HPC chips (CPUs). Intel 3 has been documented to have a lower density than TSMC 3nm but a similar PPA. Intel intends to catch up with density on Intel 18A next year to TSMC 3nm and have a lead with PPA vs TSMC 2nm/3nm node.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now to Intel Foundry's business. Intel Foundry is losing money due to the vast majority of their production being uncompetitive nodes and having much lower volume than in the past since Intel is outsourcing some production to TSMC. Sometime next year, Intel Foundry will begin to see a shift to Intel 18A. This comes with a 3x higher selling price per wafer vs. current nodes. Incremental volume will return to Intel Foundry as Intel shifts back to Intel Foundry from TSMC. Just as Intel products will slowly start to see rising ASPs at the end of this year, you can expect Intel Foundry to slowly climb out of the hole. Each quarter next year, as Intel 18A ramps up will lead to lower losses. Intel also wants external customers and has some booked, with Microsoft being the largest single customer. Intel Foundry is competing against TSMC, whose similar node to 18A is their 2nm. TSMC 2nm will ramp up at the end of 2025 and won’t have real products until sometime in 2026. This gives Intel a nice window to demonstrate to potential customers that 18A is competitive and has good yields. For a follow-on node of 14A using ASML High NA. Intel does not expect to be #1 Foundry by volume, nor do they have to be with its current valuation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately the biggest downside is Intel messes up 18A. Then I would sell, and buy $AMD. I think over the next 3 years. Intel can be north of $100 a share. The semiconductor industry operates with a large lag, Intel's current results are being driven by decisions made in early 2021. There is a lot more I could write about, but I don't want this to be too long. Let me know in comments, if you are interested.\n",
